Antiviral peptides (AVPs) are a subset of antimicrobial peptides and are a potential resource for the development of new potent therapeutics for preventing or treating viral infection. In this project we create a dataset where preprocess it and using this preproessed dataset we train some machine learning algorithm and use some evalution matrix for evaluating those model and fnally predict avp or not from real data.
